# Dö.rando (do > random)

Dö.rando is a PyQt5-based random number rolling game where players compete to achieve the highest or lowest possible rolls, with each roll generating a random number that is 11 decimal places long. The goal is to roll either the highest or lowest number, and players create a username to submit their scores, which are then displayed on a local leaderboard.
